## Qt Visual Graph Editor

**Qt Visual Graph Editor** is a multiplatform graph editor written in C++/Qt. Its main goal is to make possible visually edit two-dimensional graphs
in a simple and intuitive way.

Please note that **Qt Visual Graph Editor** is not a replacement for such a software like Gephi, Inkscape, yEd, Dia and so on. It is neither a tool for "big data analysis" nor a math application. It is really just a simple graph editor with some advanced features (i.e. GraphViz integration).

### Supported OS

**Qt Visual Graph Editor** has been tested on Microsoft Windows 10, several Linux distributions (Mint, Mageia, Fedora etc) and macOS 11.2 Big Sur. Theoretically it should run on (almost) any OS which have Qt 5.x installed.

**Qt Visual Graph Editor** can be compiled & run under Cygwin.

### Supported Qt

**Qt Visual Graph Editor** has been tested with Qt 5.9-5.14. But it should work with any newer 5.x version too.
